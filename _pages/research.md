Abstract: We study the impact of direct flight connections on international travel, the biggest tradable service sector. A novel dataset on on-site card payments made by Chinese travelers allows us to analyze the bilateral flow of international travel. We instrument the frequency of direct flights between Chinese cities and foreign countries by exploiting overseas airport expansions as exogeneous shocks. Our IV estimates indicate that a 1% increase in the weekly frequency of direct flights leads to a 1.8% increase in cross-border card transaction value. While improving air connectivity promote international travel, we find that boycotts (i.e., negative shocks to consumer preferences) can diminish this effect. This research sheds light on the role of air connectivity in shaping trade in travel services and its interaction with consumer preferences.

**Competitive Effects of Regional Airline Exit: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic**\\
with Chun-Yu Ho and Li Xu. (Draft available upon request)

<!-- *We develop a dynamic spatial growth model to explore the role of trade and internal migration in the process of spatial development and aggregate growth. Growth is shaped by the best global and local ideas that contribute to the local stock of knowledge. Global ideas diffuse more to locations that are relatively more exposed to international trade. Local ideas are diffused across space when workers move to another location. We embed the diffusion of ideas through trade and migration into a multi-country, multi-region framework with international trade, forward-looking dynamic migration decisions, and endogenous capital accumulation. We apply our framework to study the role of initial conditions, international trade, and internal migration on China’s spatial development and aggregate growth during the 1990s and 2000s. We find that initial conditions across space, idea diffusion, and capital accumulation play an important role in understanding the process of spatial development and aggregate growth in China. Changes in international trade costs and mobility restrictions during the 1990s and 2000s also contribute to aggregate growth, with large heterogeneity across space.* -->

Abstract: We examine the competitive effects of regional airline exits on the U.S. airline industry during the period from April 2019 to December 2020, using flight schedule data at the airline-market-time level and leveraging the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment. Our empirical analysis based on the propensity score matching and difference-in-differences models leads to several conclusions. At the market level, when regional airlines exit, there is a significant decrease in both flights and passengers, with no immediate replacements. Although on-time performance initially improves with an approximately 25% reduction in delays, it later reverts to the original level, and airfare rises by roughly 3.7%. Overall, consumers are worse off. On the airline market level, incumbent carriers respond by increasing flights and capacity by 11.7% and 12.2%, respectively. Low-cost and smaller carriers, in particular, capture more markets from exiting regional airlines but provide worse on-time performance and higher prices. Collectively, our findings reveal the multifaceted nature of competition dynamics in the airline industry, informing the design of effective regulatory and competitive policies to benefit consumers.

**Human Capital Accumulation, Trade, and China’s Firms Innovation**\\
with Liang Zhang, Bin Qiu, and Lamei Wu (forthcoming in China Economic Quarterly, published by Peking University Press, in Chinese)
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Abstract: Human capital is an important factor in driving economic growth. This paper uses the DID method to identify the causal effects of human capital accumulation on Chinese firms’ innovation. We find that human capital accumulation has a significant positive effect on firms’ innovation behavior and quality. In addition, trade is the key mechanism. Human capital accumulation promotes firms’ innovation through both the “factor aggregation effect” brought by import competition and the “market expansion effect” by learning effects in the export markets. The results reveal the necessity of human capital accumulation and the importance of innovation through trade openness.

**The Impact of Air Connectivity on Travel Trade: Evidence from Cross-border Card Payments**\\
with [Chun-Yu Ho, Haruka Takayama, and Li Xu]. [Job Market Paper](/assets/files/jmp.pdf)

Abstract: We study the impact of air connectivity on trade in travel services, the biggest tradable service sector. A novel dataset on on-site card payments made by Chinese travelers allows us to analyze the bilateral flow of travel services. We instrument for Chinese city-level air connectivity using a measure of destination countries' comparative advantage in air transportation. Our IV estimates indicate that a 1\% increase in the weekly frequency of direct flights leads to a 1.8\% increase in cross-border card transaction value. While air connections promote cross-border trade in travel services, we find that negative shocks to consumer tastes can diminish this effect. By contrast, such changes in consumer preferences have no effect on trade in goods. This research sheds light on the role of air connectivity in shaping trade in travel services and its interaction with consumer preferences.



**Competitive Effects of Regional Airline Exit: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic**\\
with [Chun-Yu Ho and Li Xu].

<!-- *We develop a dynamic spatial growth model to explore the role of trade and internal migration in the process of spatial development and aggregate growth. Growth is shaped by the best global and local ideas that contribute to the local stock of knowledge. Global ideas diffuse more to locations that are relatively more exposed to international trade. Local ideas are diffused across space when workers move to another location. We embed the diffusion of ideas through trade and migration into a multi-country, multi-region framework with international trade, forward-looking dynamic migration decisions, and endogenous capital accumulation. We apply our framework to study the role of initial conditions, international trade, and internal migration on Chinaâ€™s spatial development and aggregate growth during the 1990s and 2000s. We find that initial conditions across space, idea diffusion, and capital accumulation play an important role in understanding the process of spatial development and aggregate growth in China. Changes in international trade costs and mobility restrictions during the 1990s and 2000s also contribute to aggregate growth, with large heterogeneity across space.* -->

Abstract: We examine the competitive effects of regional airline exit on market share, pricing, and quality provision based on the airline-market-time level data from the U.S. over the year 2000. The identification of competitive effects comes from the exogenous shock to the survival of regional airlines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our empirical analysis based on the propensity score matching and difference-in-differences model leads to several conclusions. First, at the market level, the number of flights and passengers decreases significantly after a regional airline exits. In other words, there is no entry right after the exit.  Second, the airfare (on-time performance) of the markets experiencing regional airline exit increases by about 4.3% (decreases by about 31.1% delay) on average compared to those of the markets without any regional airline exit. Third, at the airline market level, incumbents increase their number of flights and capacity by 12.5%. In particular, smaller airlines capture more market share from the regional airlines that exit the market. Overall, our results suggest that consumers are worse off in terms of airfare but better off in terms of on-time performance after an airline exit, and inform the proper design of competition and regulatory policies for the airline industry.
